# RLJ Canvas Helper
 **WHAT IS IT?**
 
 Easy to use script that shows where to build things!
 
 **HOW DOES IT WORK?**
 
 It works using TamperMonkey https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo & installing the script RLJScript.user.js - which reads from an Imgur file of the entire canvas, but only has our relevant info on it!
 
 **REQUIRMENTS**
 
 Just TamperMonkey and the script - refresh r/place once installed
